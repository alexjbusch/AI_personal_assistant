# AI_personal_assistant
An Iron Man style personal assistant powered by cutting edge speech to speech AI


This project combines anywhere from two to three different applications of audio based AI.  First, a speech recognition AI converts voice to text.  In a later version, that text will be fed into a state of the art chatbot like gpt-3.  When the command or question has been parsed by the script, it uses the resemble.ai api to convert the script's response to realistic sounding audio from text.
